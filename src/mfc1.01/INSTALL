=== For linux:

	Type "make -f Makefile.linux" to get the "MFCompressC" (encoder) and
	"MFCompressD" (decoder) executables.

=== For windows (32 bits), using a cross-compiler in linux:

	Type "make -f Makefile.win32" to get the "MFCompressC32.exe"
	(encoder) and "MFCompressD32.exe" (decoder) executables. You need to
	have installed MinGW-w64 (http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/) to be able
	to generate these binaries. If you do not know what I'm talking about,
	please use the precompiled executables available in a companion package.

=== For windows (64 bits), using a cross-compiler in linux:

	Type "make -f Makefile.win64" to get the "MFCompressC64.exe"
